Guess what? We have a blog now! ðŸŽ‰

This is where we'll be sharing all the exciting news, updates, and behind-the-scenes peeks about AnimePack. Whether it's new features, improvements, or just some fun stuff we're working on, you'll find it all here.

We are still setting things up and learning how to use it properly, so stay tuned for more updates.

For a near future, we plan on adding a news page for animes/mangas as well. So, keep an eye out for that!

Also adding trailers and more details to each anime/manga page is on our to-do list.

Thanks for being part of the AnimePack community! Your support means the world to us. ðŸ’œ
